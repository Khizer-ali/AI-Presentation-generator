## ⭐ Featured Project — Developer Tools & CLI Utilities
**Project Name** — Tools & utilities for faster developer workflows  
A collection of CLI tools and helper libraries I built to automate repetitive tasks, speed up local development, and standardize deployments.

**Highlights**
- CLI to scaffold projects and standardize repositories
- Scripts for local dev environment setup and data seeding
- Small utilities to validate configs, run bulk migrations, and audit dependencies

**Quick start**
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone <PASTE_YOUR_GITHUB_LINK>/project-name.git
cd project-name

# install (example)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the CLI (example)
python -m project_name.cli init
